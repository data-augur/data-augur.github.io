        <h3><a href="/art1.html">Sol LeWitt-1</a></h3>
        <p> I love Sol LeWitt's wall drawings his work is really truely facinating, It is amazing how he craeted such master pieces with just black and white. This is the first piece of Art I recreated, you can check it out at <a href="https://jorgeriverospintor.wordpress.com/2015/04/02/the-met-announces-sol-lewitt-wall-drawing/">here.</a></p>
